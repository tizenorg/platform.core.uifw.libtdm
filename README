libtdm - Tizen Display Manager

It's the display HAL layer for tizen display server. It offers the frontend
APIs(tdm.h) for a frontend user and the abstraction interface(tdm_backend.h)
for a hardware vendor.

TDM consists of display/output/layer/pp/capture objects. A frontend user can
get the output/layer/pp/capture hardware information with each object.
Basically, TDM supposes that all hardware devices have fixed outputs and layers.

All changes of output/layer/pp/capture objects are applied when committed.

TDM has its own buffer release mechanism to let an user know when a TDM buffer
becomes available for a next job.
